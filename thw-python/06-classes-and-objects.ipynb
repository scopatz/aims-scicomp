      "**Object oriented programming** is a way of thinking about and defining how different pieces of software and ideas work together. In objected oriented programming, there are two main interfaces: **classes** and **objects**.  \n",
      "\n",
      "* **Classes** are types of things such as int, float, person, or square.\n",
      "* **Objects** are **instances** of those types such a 1, 42.0, me, and a square with side length 2.\n",
      "\n",
      "Unlike functional or procedural paradigms, there are three main features that classes provide.\n",
      "\n",
      "* **Encapsulation:** Classes are container which may have any kind of other programming element living on them: variables, functions, and even other classes. In Python, members of a class are known as **attributes** for normal variables and **methods** for functions.\n",
      "* **Inheritence:** A class may automatically gain all of the attributes and methods from another class it is related to.  The new class is called a  **subclass** or sometimes a **subtype**.  Multiple levels of inheritance sets up a **class heirarchy**. For example:\n",
      "\n",
      "    Shape is a class with an area attribute.\n",
