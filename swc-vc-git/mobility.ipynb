      "\n",
      "One of the powerful ways to use version control is to maintain your workflow\n",
      "between the office, home, and wherever else you find yourself being\n",
      "productive. This type of workflow can be used extensively with both research\n",
      "work (i.e., coding project collaboration) and thesis writing (i.e., \"personal\"\n",
      "activities).\n",
      "\n",
      "The workflow in this section describes three repository locations - a server, a\n",
      "work computer, and a home (laptop) computer. The server will host the \"base\"\n",
      "repository, and the server can live anywhere you have a connection to. For\n",
      "example, you could use your GitHub repository (described in the\n",
      "[Collaborate](../remote/Readme.md) section) as the server. If you have access to\n",
      "a server on campus (e.g., server.uni.edu), you can host your repository there\n",
      "(and it's private!).\n",
      "\n",
      "For the purposes of this exercise, all of the repositories will be represented\n",
      "by different folders on your ACI user space in order to provide you with the\n",
      "\"flavor\" of how such a workflow would work. For example, we'll use ~/work to\n",
      "represent your work station. You should assume that ~/work is effectively your\n",
